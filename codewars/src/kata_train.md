# Train 1: Convert a String to a Number!
Note: This kata is inspired by Convert a Number to a String!. Try that one too.

Description
We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.


# Train 2: Find the smallest integer in the array
Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

For example:

Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2

Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345

You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.
